    This function creates a Hub instance with a fully mocked MQTT client,
    allowing you to simulate MQTT messages and test Hub behavior without
    connecting to an actual MQTT broker.
    
    Args:
        installation_id: Optional Victron installation ID. If None, will be
            automatically set to "123" during connection.
        operation_mode: The operation mode for the Hub (FULL, READ_ONLY, or EXPERIMENTAL).
        device_type_exclude_filter: Optional list of device types to exclude from processing.
        update_frequency_seconds: Optional update frequency for metrics in seconds.
        disable_keepalive_loop: If True (default), disables the keepalive loop to prevent
            background tasks during testing. Set to False if you need to test keepalive behavior.

        A Hub instance with a mocked MQTT client, ready for testing.
